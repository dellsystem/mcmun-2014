However, McMUN is truly recognized for its success in balancing the traditional academic merits of MUN whilst staying true to the changing realities of the international system. McMUN has and will continue to be at the forefront of committee-based innovation with previous successes including the entirely online and personality based World Economic Forum, dynamic Triple Joint crisis, an ever-changing Ad-Hoc tackling WII and the Pixar Board of Directors. McMUN 2013\u2019s twenty-six committees have been carefully chosen to tackle a range of topics, sure to challenge even the most experienced delegates in unexpected ways and certain not to disappoint. \r\n\r\nEvents like the Leadership Luncheon and the Head-Delegate Cocktail, our budding network of global MUN conferences and the Delegation Scholarship program demonstrate McMUN\u2019s commitment to fostering a global Model UN community. However, we need your help in making this dream a reality. The more international relations clubs, the more schools and the more countries that attend, the larger this global community, the ideal embodiment of the UN spirit, can grow.   \r\n\r\nDespite the snow, we want to make sure our guests have a warm welcome in Montreal. This year\u2019s Friday night Pub Crawl will be a night not to be forgotten, an experience that can only be followed by our famed McParte, a chance for our 1400 delegates and 500 dedicated staff members to celebrate their weekend\u2019s accomplishments. \r\n\r\nCome experience the next chapter in McMUN\u2019s legacy as we expand the horizons of the traditional Model UN mindset and build a global Model UN community. We hope to see you this January! \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nMickaela Nixon  \r\nSecretary-General, McMUN 2013 ",

Founded in 1821 by James McGill, making it the oldest university in Canada, McGill successfully merges rich history with leading edge research. Over 36 thousand students attend McGill from over 150 countries, making McGill the most internationally diverse medical-doctoral university in Canada. McGill has been home to:\r\n\r\n* the creation of the first artificial cell;\r\n* the 1908 Nobel Prize Laureate Ernest Rutherford;\r\n* award-winning novelist Hugh MacLennan (1907-1990) a pioneer of Canadian literature;\r\n* Henry Mintzberg, current Professor of Management and frequent contributor to both _The New York Times_ and _The Economist_;\r\n* two former Canadian Prime Ministers; four justices of the Supreme Court of Canada; former presidents of both Latvia and Egypt and former principal of McGill University and current Governor General of Canada David Johnston;\r\n* and Professor of Law John Humphrey (1905-1995), one of the 18-member international committee selected to draft the founding documents to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and who was Director of the United Nations Human Rights Division for over 20 years.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [www.mcgill.ca](http://www.mcgill.ca/).\r\n\r\n## Student life\r\n\r\nA strong history of student activism and involvement pervades student life. Student run programming by TVMcGill and the numerous student-run newspapers including the _McGill Daily_ (the oldest student publication in Canada), _Le Delit francais_, _McGill Foreign Affairs Review_ and the internationally renowned _McGill Law Journal_ are a few examples of student-driven endeavors on campus. Numerous NGOs also operate on campus, including UNICEF McGill, End Poverty Now and McMUN's parent organization (the International Relations Students' Association of McGill), which has consultative status within the United Nations' ECOSOC and UNESCO.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [ssmu.mcgill.ca](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/).",

In 2006, Montreal was officially designated a UNESCO City of Design, honouring  its cultural diversity with strong entrepreneurial and creative potential, as well as a flourishing contemporary art, fashion, architecture, music and design scene. However, you will quickly forget you are in North America as you stroll down the romantic cobblestone streets of the historic Old Port.\r\n\r\nCrescent, St. Laurent and the Latin Quarter, a few of Montreal\u2019s most notorious streets, all lined with vivacious clubs, pubs, microbreweries and 5-star dance floors. Montreal's nightlife is certain to test the endurance of even the most experienced enthusiasts. And on weekends, events like the Tam-tams and Piknic Electronik, each minutes away from downtown, cater to a more relaxed clientele. \r\n\r\nWe welcome you to the city of Montreal, the city with something for everyone, all year-round.

This section of the website will cover everything you need to prepare for your role as a delegate in any of the diverse committees we are simulating at this year\u2019s McGill Model United Nations Assembly. Each committee has an individual page containing information about the dais members, a welcome letter from your chair and, most importantly, a background guide and relevant committee materials. \r\n\r\nYou will also find important information about our position paper and awards policies as you navigate through the site. Whether this is your first experience at a Model UN conference or your sixteenth, this information will ensure that you are well prepared so that you can have the best committee experience possible!\r\n\r\nThis years Team Committees is graced with three capable members also looking to enhance your committee experience. Abhinav Gupta brings his years of experience and knowledge to challenge all crises delegates. Rohan Arora, heading up GAs and ECOSOCs, will ensure that even the largest committees are exciting and well-run with his international perspective. Finally, Kegan Chang complements the Specialized Agencies Portfolio with a keen eye for detail and creativity bordering on obsession.\r\n\r\nThis year's committees are not for the faint of heart. In committees like [DC Comics](/committees/dc-comics) and the [American War on Organized Crime](/committees/awoc), delegates will be required to think outside the box for the weekend. Working outside the normal parameters of your committee will guarantee that all those who take part will have a unique MUN experience, bolstered by the unprecedented connectivity that Team Committees, and the McMUN 2013 Secretariat, is working to ensure.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about anything committees related, do not hesitate to contact me at [committees@mcmun.org](mailto:committees@mcmun.org).\r\n\r\nGood luck, and see you in January!\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nAbdaal Mazhar Shafi  \r\nUndersecretary-General Committee Affairs, 2012-2013",
