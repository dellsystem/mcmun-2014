However, McMUN is truly recognized for its success in balancing the traditional academic merits of MUN whilst staying true to the changing realities of the international system. McMUN has and will continue to be at the forefront of committee-based innovation with previous successes including the entirely online and personality based World Economic Forum, dynamic Triple Joint crisis, an ever-changing Ad-Hoc tackling WII and the Pixar Board of Directors. McMUN 2013\u2019s twenty-six committees have been carefully chosen to tackle a range of topics, sure to challenge even the most experienced delegates in unexpected ways and certain not to disappoint. \r\n\r\nEvents like the Leadership Luncheon and the Head-Delegate Cocktail, our budding network of global MUN conferences and the Delegation Scholarship program demonstrate McMUN\u2019s commitment to fostering a global Model UN community. However, we need your help in making this dream a reality. The more international relations clubs, the more schools and the more countries that attend, the larger this global community, the ideal embodiment of the UN spirit, can grow.   \r\n\r\nDespite the snow, we want to make sure our guests have a warm welcome in Montreal. This year\u2019s Friday night Pub Crawl will be a night not to be forgotten, an experience that can only be followed by our famed McParte, a chance for our 1400 delegates and 500 dedicated staff members to celebrate their weekend\u2019s accomplishments. \r\n\r\nCome experience the next chapter in McMUN\u2019s legacy as we expand the horizons of the traditional Model UN mindset and build a global Model UN community. We hope to see you this January! \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nMickaela Nixon  \r\nSecretary-General, McMUN 2013 ",

Founded in 1821 by James McGill, making it the oldest university in Canada, McGill successfully merges rich history with leading edge research. Over 36 thousand students attend McGill from over 150 countries, making McGill the most internationally diverse medical-doctoral university in Canada. McGill has been home to:\r\n\r\n* the creation of the first artificial cell;\r\n* the 1908 Nobel Prize Laureate Ernest Rutherford;\r\n* award-winning novelist Hugh MacLennan (1907-1990) a pioneer of Canadian literature;\r\n* Henry Mintzberg, current Professor of Management and frequent contributor to both _The New York Times_ and _The Economist_;\r\n* two former Canadian Prime Ministers; four justices of the Supreme Court of Canada; former presidents of both Latvia and Egypt and former principal of McGill University and current Governor General of Canada David Johnston;\r\n* and Professor of Law John Humphrey (1905-1995), one of the 18-member international committee selected to draft the founding documents to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and who was Director of the United Nations Human Rights Division for over 20 years.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [www.mcgill.ca](http://www.mcgill.ca/).\r\n\r\n## Student life\r\n\r\nA strong history of student activism and involvement pervades student life. Student run programming by TVMcGill and the numerous student-run newspapers including the _McGill Daily_ (the oldest student publication in Canada), _Le Delit francais_, _McGill Foreign Affairs Review_ and the internationally renowned _McGill Law Journal_ are a few examples of student-driven endeavors on campus. Numerous NGOs also operate on campus, including UNICEF McGill, End Poverty Now and McMUN's parent organization (the International Relations Students' Association of McGill), which has consultative status within the United Nations' ECOSOC and UNESCO.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [ssmu.mcgill.ca](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/).",
