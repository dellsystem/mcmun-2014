However, McMUN is truly recognized for its success in balancing the traditional academic merits of MUN whilst staying true to the changing realities of the international system. McMUN has and will continue to be at the forefront of committee-based innovation with previous successes including the entirely online and personality based World Economic Forum, dynamic Triple Joint crisis, an ever-changing Ad-Hoc tackling WII and the Pixar Board of Directors. McMUN 2013\u2019s twenty-six committees have been carefully chosen to tackle a range of topics, sure to challenge even the most experienced delegates in unexpected ways and certain not to disappoint. \r\n\r\nEvents like the Leadership Luncheon and the Head-Delegate Cocktail, our budding network of global MUN conferences and the Delegation Scholarship program demonstrate McMUN\u2019s commitment to fostering a global Model UN community. However, we need your help in making this dream a reality. The more international relations clubs, the more schools and the more countries that attend, the larger this global community, the ideal embodiment of the UN spirit, can grow.   \r\n\r\nDespite the snow, we want to make sure our guests have a warm welcome in Montreal. This year\u2019s Friday night Pub Crawl will be a night not to be forgotten, an experience that can only be followed by our famed McParte, a chance for our 1400 delegates and 500 dedicated staff members to celebrate their weekend\u2019s accomplishments. \r\n\r\nCome experience the next chapter in McMUN\u2019s legacy as we expand the horizons of the traditional Model UN mindset and build a global Model UN community. We hope to see you this January! \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nMickaela Nixon  \r\nSecretary-General, McMUN 2013 ",

You will find authentic cuisine of every variety to satisfy your taste buds.\r\n\r\nOften described as a Parisian New York, Montreal is the perfect combination of classic European and modern metropolis. In 2006, Montreal was officially designated a UNESCO City of Design, honouring its cultural diversity with strong entrepreneurial and creative potential, as well as a flourishing contemporary art, fashion, architecture, music and design scene. However, you will quickly forget you are in North America as you stroll down the romantic cobblestone streets of the historic Old Port.\r\n \r\nCrescent, St. Laurent and the Latin Quarter, a few of Montreal\u2019s most notorious streets, are home to vivacious clubs, pubs, microbreweries and 5-star dance floors. Montreal's nightlife is certain to test the endurance of even the most experienced enthusiasts. And on weekends, events like the Tam-tams and Piknic Electronik, each minutes away from downtown, cater to a more relaxed clientele. \r\n\r\nWe welcome you to the city of Montreal.
