		<h2>Mickaela Nixon</h2>
		<h3>Secretary-General</h3>
		<p>Born and raised in Calgary, Canada, Mickaela proudly embodies Alberta's infamous diplomatic tact and understated sophistication. She has left the oil rich soils of Alberta for the culture capital that is Montreal and McGill, bringing with her a passion for Model UN. She is currently pursuing a degree in Physical Biology with a minor in Economics with the hopes of never being stuck in an office. In the rare instance when she is not studying, pipetting random fluids, worrying about McMUN or watching MASH she can be seen relaxing in her cowboy boots, talking about last night's hockey game.</p>
		<p>Mickaela is excited to invite all Model UN enthusiasts to the beautiful city of Montreal, to enjoy the tastes, sights and sounds of her adopted home for what is sure to be a conference to remember.</p>

		<h2>Daniel Stysis</h2>
		<h3>Chargé d'Affaires</h3>
		<p>This is that guy who will be the professional face of McMUN 2013 for all your questions, comments, concerns, and special requests, so please, treat him with fluffy kindness as you develop a relationship with this ginger in the months leading up to the conference. An avid MUNer and an international affairs junkie, Daniel Stysis is spending his McGill career pursuing a B.A. in Political Science, Economics, with a hint of Psychology, picking classes based on their relevance to his passion rather than to labor market conditions. Believing that the delegates are the raison d'être of any MUN enterprise, Daniel is fully committed to carrying the mantle of the delegates’ voice in his role as the Chargé d’Affaires on the McMUN 2013 Secretariat. Daniel is confident that McMUN 2013 will build on its solid reputation, continuing to be an international gathering where the perfect balance of “work hard, party hard” is not an ideal, but a compulsory way of life since 1990. </p>

		<h3>Chief of Operations</h3>
		<p>A man of many cultures and talents, Shadi Afana towers over photocopiers and the rest of this year's Secretariat as the Chief of Operations for McMUN 2013. Shadi is currently a third year chemical engineering student. Arab, Norwegian, Canadian, Mexican, Shadi has had a taste of every culture, and can't wait to experience whatever else that awaits him. Having been brought up in five different countries and fluent in three languages, model United Nations was undoubtedly his calling. Having been a delegate at McMUN, he is extremely excited about planning what will be the best edition of the conference for you. At the helm of this year's logistics, Shadi cannot wait to craft a McParte experience that will leave you with the best of memories, or lack thereof. If you have any questions about the internet not working, printing, and how to have a generally good time during your stay in Montreal, rest assured that Shadi is your go-to man.</p>

		<h2>Emma Stanton</h2>
		<h3>Chief of Staff</h3>
		<p>Emma Stanton, known as “The Chief,” is in her fourth year at McGill, studying International Development Studies and minoring in Anthropology. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, Emma has made her way up the eastern United States and Canada, living in Connecticut and Toronto, before calling Montreal home. While all the other kids were dealing with enraged hormones, Emma was participating in the Secondary School United Nations Symposium (SSUNS), Southern Ontario Model United Nations Assembly (SOMA), and The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN), as well. Emma knows that you’re no one until someone calls you bossy, so taking on logistical staff positions at SSUNS and McMUN, as well as Delegate Resource Center Coordinator at SSUNS 2011 and Page Coordinator at McMUN 2012 were nothing short of successes.</p>
		<p>Emma’s not so guilty pleasure is her zest and fiery passion for Latin America and all things Spanish. Her pursuit of the quintessential Latin lover only comes second to her more philanthropic endeavors, being involved with the McGill chapter of Right to Play and serving as a member of the Arts Undergraduate Society Charity Committee. While Canada does not offer her the same warmth that Cuba, Mexico, or Colombia would, she has come to love lacing up her snow boats and throwing on her parka to enjoy Montreal’s amazing night life. Emma cannot wait to throw down at McParté and pub-crawl and provide the delegates of McMUN 2013 with an experience they will never forget!</p>

		<h2>Sabrina Ostrowski</h2>
		<h3>Director of Public Relations</h3>
		<p>Born and raised right here in Montreal, Sabrina is McMUN’s Director of “Puuublic Relaaaaytions.” Polish at heart and Can’eh’dian by birth, she is a true citizen of the world. Her desire to become a super-human has led her to travel to almost thirty countries and take on six different languages, Arabic being her proudest feat…thus far. Sabrina studies International Management at McGill University, bearing minors in Middle-Eastern Studies and International Relations. To the untrained eye, the schedule she keeps is borderline insane, but her rebuttal lies in that her huge aspirations require quite the head start. She tells anyone who listens that she’ll one day stand as the Canadian ambassador to the IAEA, a fascination she fosters as the resident nuclear specialist of the McGill delegation. Oddly obsessed with Iranian politicians and an avid fan of the ukulele, she always finds time to explore Montreal’s finest breweries. Although Sabrina is the conference’s youngest Director of Public Relations yet, this will be her fourth McMUN, having previously participated as a delegate, Head Delegate, and Vice-Chair.</p>
		<p>She will be taking her PR duties to unchartered territories and has made it her personal mission to keep the party (and diplomacy) going 24/7. Dubbed ‘the loud one’ of the Secretariat, Sabrina and her flamboyant blazers won’t be hard to miss during the conference.</p>

		<h3>PR Representative</h3>
		<p>Entering her 2nd year at McGill University, Esther is pursuing a major in Honours International Development Studies and a double minor in Middle East Studies and International Relations. Esther’s love for international politics and blazers was firmly established at her first MUN Conference during her middle school career in Toronto, Ontario. Ever since, she has participated in several conferences as a delegate and a coordinator across North America. Esther values her employment experiences in the fields of event planning and corporate relations, and she looks forward to applying these skills to her PR portfolio. As a veteran in the world of Model United Nations, she is excited to be working with the members of the secretariat in making McMUN '13 an escapade that is both unforgettable and worthwhile. When Esther is not busy filling out sponsorship requests, she can be seen frolicking under the Montreal sun, around the city known as a cultural paradise. Esther, with her knack for showing the Montreal hospitality, is thrilled to welcome all of you to McMUN 2013!</p>

		<h2>Natasha Racco</h2>
		<h3>PR Representative</h3>
		<p>Once every generation, there is a strong female who proves to shatter the proverbial glass ceiling all the while calling Angelina Jolie her BFF, but Natasha Racco is not this woman. She has met this woman and quite frankly they didn’t see eye to eye. Natasha is a fourth year student majoring in International Development Studies and accompanying her program en Français y en Español. She comes to us from the enclaves of a forgotten time, the land known only to its enigmatic inhabitants as Oakville, Ontario. This year she is joining the McMUN ensemble as a Public Relations Representative, searching high and low for our most treasured sponsorship that has allowed a conference of this magnitude to excel year after year. McMUN 2013 is like the crème de la crème of all culinary creations and this amateur baker has set her sights on the dough. With more in common with the Cake Boss than she cares to admit, this Ital-Irish-Scot-Canadian is from a noisy family that can never seem to spend enough time with each other, professional sphere being no exception. Drawing from her short time as a delegate, well-spent hours as a staffer and her cherished time working on The Ambassador, Natasha is hoping to increase the social participation of McMUN delegates with each other and our McGill staff throughout the year. The Public Relations team is chalk full of estrogen and not ashamed to show it.</p>

Despite her interest in health science, Chloe has always been passionate about international relations and diplomacy. In the past she has been involved with numerous Model UN simulations, WHO simulations, and the G8G20 Youth Summit in Paris last summer. She has continued to pursue her passion for reconciling social and economic issues by working for the McGill Model United Nations Assembly and numerous charitable organizations on campus.

		<h3>USG-Committees</h3>
		<p>Bestowed with the title of “Action Man” by the previous SG, because flying rodents weren’t his thing (or so he wants you to believe), Abdaal Mazhar Shafi returns to the McMUN Secretariat as this year’s USG Committees. Born in Singapore with a Pakistani heritage, his engineering studies have not deterred him from his love of Model UN as he goes through life with a YOLO mentality. When not in the engineering dungeons of McGill, Abdaal can be found challenging girls to dance offs, not drinking coffee, or saving lives with his superpowers. Now in his third year at McGill, Abdaal brings his plethora of experience and creative prowess to helm McMUN’s committees and make them more dynamic, lively, and memorable than ever before. Having been a Mc-delegate in the past, he plans on pushing delegates to the brink of their creativity and sanity. He, along with the rest of team committees, looks forward to welcoming you with ridiculous high fives come January.</p>

		<h3>Deputy USG-Committees, GAs and ECOSOCS</h3>
		<p>Born in the bustling metropolis of Mumbai, Rohan quickly moved to Singapore to finish middle and high school before ending his globetrotting, at least for now, in Montréal. Now in his second year at McGill, he is pursuing a major in Economics with a double minor in Finance and International Relations. Despite his seemingly eclectic tastes, he aspires to enter the corporate world or study law, hoping that the next few years at McGill will make him reach a conclusive decision. A devout Model United Nations enthusiast, McMUN 2013 will be Rohan’s tenth conference as he takes on the helm of this year’s General Assemblies and Economic and Social Councils. Always ready for new adventures, he is a fond traveler and a keen follower of Anthony Bourdain’s travel shows. Having visited over 18 countries, he hopes one day to conquer the experience of crossing the vast Trans-Siberian Railway. When not working on school, or toiling through background guides, you will probably find him enjoying a glass of Moscato wine with bulgogi, distracting his friends, or trying to convince others of his deep takes on life. Excitement would be an understatement to capture Rohan’s sentiments for this year’s conference and he hopes to work with you all to craft a committee experience that will not only be riveting, but extremely fun in true McMUN spirit!</p>

		<h2>Kegan Chang</h2>
		<h3>Deputy USG-Committees, Specialised Agencies</h3>
		<p>Kegan Chang was born a Canadian, but was raised by Southeast Asia. He is in his third year of study at McGill, working towards his Bachelor’s in Political Science with a minor in Psychology. Upon graduation, he believes that these degrees render him supremely qualified to become a Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot Lord with one eye and a pet monkey. His previous experiences with Model United Nations include Chairing, Vice-Chairing and Crisis Staffing McMUN and SSUNS. He was also a proud and underperforming member of the McGill delegation to NCSC and VICS in the 2011/2012 school year, and his lack of achievement have prompted stern disapproval from his Asian parents. He likens the experience of managing the Specialized Agencies at McMUN2013 to running a psychology experiment while directing a play and writing apolitical treatise in a pressure cooker, all of which he hopes to one day accomplish simultaneously.</p>
		<p>Kegan fell in love with MUN in general and McMUN in particular because of the intense effort and creativity needed to create a full stable of diverse, interesting worlds for intense, incredible individuals to play in and explore. He hopes that you will find this year’s crop of Specialized Agencies up to the mark of conferences, and invites you to come and work your machinations in the realms he has supervised the making of. 
He invites you to contact him at sa@mcmun.org with any questions and reminds you to treat your committee staff and chairs nicely: they bite, and if they don’t, he will.</p>

		<h2>Abhinav Gupta</h2>
		<h3>Deputy USG-Committees, Crises</h3>
		<p>Born and raised in Montreal, Abhinav thought studying at McGill a natural choice since his primary schooling. Thinking he’d be studying science after his secondary schooling, he – and his unexpectedly old-school brown family – was taken aback by how speedily he decided to make the change to political science. Abhinav most probably thinks of political science as a great complementary to MUN. Only in his U2 in political science and having done six years of MUN, it wouldn’t be far off to call MUN more than just an extracurricular for him. It was love at first effort when Abhinav made a go at crisis committees for the first time. In keeping with that spirit, Abhinav wants all delegates in crisis committees at McMUN 2013 to experience what it feels like to be crisis virgins again. Given the extraordinary quality of delegates that attend McMUN, he realizes that this is going to be a tall order. Nonetheless, he feels like it’s one he can handle given that he’s 6’8” tall with a wingspan that would puzzle even Howard Hughes – we needed some family-friendly humour; take it or leave it. Abhinav takes advantage of this size by spanning the whole court when playing squash, having no choice but to have suits made to measure, and walking around with Shadi and Abdaal taking delegates’ lunches –especially if they call for the ever-loved clause-by-clause roll-call vote.</p>

		<h2>Lea El Houssami</h2>
		<h3>Undersecretary-General, Finance</h3>
		<p>Lea, born and raised in three different countries, is McMUN’s Chief Financial Officer. Although she is the youngest member of the Secretariat, her wisdom is beyond her years. This has earned her the respect of many, and led her colleagues to entrust her with their wallets. Lea is in her second year of International Management studies at McGill, where her love of travel and blazers converge. She has been involved in Model UN for three years, having gained experience as a delegate, director and crisis staffer.</p>
		<p>Envied by many, teased by some, Lea works at a zoo (who knew Montreal had zoos?). Although she thoroughly enjoys spending time with wild creatures, other than her fellow Secretariat members, zoo-keeping is not in Lea’s long-term vision. Few would be surprised to learn that she hopes to one day become involved in the “real” United Nations, as an ambassador to the Middle-East.</p>
		<p>Her greatest ambition is to visit every country at least once and to wed Daniel Radcliffe – Lea would however argue that the latter is not a dream, but rather an inevitable occurrence waiting to happen.</p>
		<p>This will be Lea’s third McMUN, assuming she will survive the months of balance statements leading up to it.</p>
