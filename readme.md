McMUN 2014
==========

This is the source for the codebase that I originally wrote for the McMUN
2013 website. It is also being used to power the McMUN 2014 and SSUNS 2013
websites. Built with Django.

Usage information
-----------------

### Disclaimer

If you want to use this codebase for your own website, keep in mind that the
site was built for a very specific purpose (i.e., McMUN 2013), and thus
there may be issues with adapting it for other purposes. There is also some
hastily tacked-on code that I couldn't avoid, which I'm not too proud of.
I cannot be held responsible for any issues (e.g., data loss, weight loss,
hair loss) that may arise from the usage of this codebase.

### Editing content

There is a homegrown content management system application installed. It
provides a web interface for managing the menu as well as the content of the
pages showing up in the menu. It's fairly rudimentary, so you can't do
anything complicated like form processing or user customisation (see the
[Editing functionality](#editing-functionality) section below for info on
that). However, it does make managing content much easier.

To use it, first log in to the admin panel (www.example.com/admin/)

#### Adding a page

Do you want the page to show up as a top-level link in the menu bar?

Licensing information
---------------------

This repository isn't licensed under any of the standard OSI-approved
licenses because I couldn't really find one that fit. In non-legal terms:
feel free to use any Python/JS/LESS snippets you see. Attribution is not
required. Please don't use the content, however. Please also refrain from
copying the design wholesale. That would make me sad.

Source information for the images:

* The background image (of Montreal) is a modified (cropped and darkened)
  version of a photo taken by [Anirudh
  Koul](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anirudhkoul/). The original is
  available under [CC-BY-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/
  "I mean, I'm not making any money from this, so that counts as
  non-commercial usage, right?") and I guess I'll release the derivative
  under the same license because why not.  The bridge photo on the homepage,
  the photo of Montreal on the "About Montreal" page and the photo of McGill
  on the "About McGill" page are all public domain. The originals can be
  found on the Wikimedia Commons page for Montreal/McGill.
* The photos and logo on the "Venue" page are from the [Sheraton Centre
  website](http://www.sheratoncentremontreal.com). Should be fair use, or
  whatever. The Tourisme Montreal and Star Alliance logos came from
  somewhere. Same as above.
* The image on the "Sponsoring McMUN" page is just a preview of the first
  page of the sponsorship package, which was created by Jad El Houssami.
* The photos on the "Contact us" and "Meet the secretariat" pages are,
  pretty obviously, photos of secretariat members.
* The photos in the Registration/Welcome/Committees block on the home page
  were taken by either a secretariat member or someone related to McMUN in
  some way.  The rest of the images - the dove, the logo, the contact icons
  in the header - I created in Inkscape. They're not available under any
  sort of copyleft license, unfortunately. Using the logo for illustration
  purposes in the context of McMUN is, of course, totally fine.
