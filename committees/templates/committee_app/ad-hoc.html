Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the Ad-Hoc Committee of the Secretary
General. This committee will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced
staffers. Moreover, with little background preparation, the Ad-Hoc Committee is one of
the most challenging and intensive committees offered at McMUN 2013. On that note,
Team Committees and the Ad-Hoc dais encourage the most experienced delegates to
apply.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more enjoyable and
productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into the different skills that
each interested applicant could bring to the committee, with the goal of creating the most
productive committee dynamic possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any
questions regarding the Ad-Hoc at this year’s McMUN.
