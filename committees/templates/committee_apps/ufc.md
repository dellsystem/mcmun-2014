Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the UFC committee. This committee
will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers as a
specialized agency. Moreover, the intense background preparation by the dais
promises to make UFC a highly challenging and rewarding endeavour. On that note,
Team Committees and the dais encourage the most experienced delegates to apply,
who also have the necessary background knowledge.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more
enjoyable and productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into
the different skills that each interested applicant could bring to the
committee, with the goal of creating the most productive committee dynamic
possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding UFC
at this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,

Brendan Sheehan
