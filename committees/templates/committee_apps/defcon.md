Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the DEFCON committee. This committee
will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers as a joint
crisis committee, divided into Western
Allies (USA + ROK), and Eastern Allies (PRC + DPRK). Moreover, with the unique
setup of this committee, DEFCON promises to challenge delegates at an
unprecedented level. Furthermore, with little background preparation, the DEFCON
committee is one of the most challenging and intensive committees offered at
McMUN 2014. On that note, Team Committees and the Ad-Hoc dais encourage the most
experienced delegates to apply.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more
enjoyable and productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into
the different skills that each interested applicant could bring to the
committee, with the goal of creating the most productive committee dynamic
possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding the
DEFCON at this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,

Brendan Sheehan
