Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the International Criminal Court
committee. This committee will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most
experienced staffers as a specialized agency. Moreover, the intense background
preparation by the dais promises to make International Criminal Court a highly
challenging and rewarding endeavour. On that note, Team Committees and the dais
encourage the most experienced delegates to apply, who also have the necessary
background knowledge.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more
enjoyable and productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into
the different skills that each interested applicant could bring to the
committee, with the goal of creating the most productive committee dynamic
possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding
International Criminal Court at this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,

Brendan Sheehan
