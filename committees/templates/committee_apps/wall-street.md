Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the Wall Street 2008 committee. This
committee will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers as a
specialized agency. Moreover, the intense background preparation by the dais promises
to make Wall Street 2008 a highly challenging and rewarding endeavour. On that note,
Team Committees and the dais encourage the most experienced delegates to apply, who
also have the necessary background knowledge.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more enjoyable and
productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into the different skills that
each interested applicant could bring to the committee, with the goal of creating the most
productive committee dynamic possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any
questions regarding Wall Street 2008 at this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,

Abdaal Mazhar Shafi
